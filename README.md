# DEVSimPy
# What is DEVSimPy
DEVSimPy is an wxPython-based environment for the simulation of complex systems defined by the DEVS formalism. Its development is supported by the SPE research laboratory team. The main goal of this environment is to facilitate the modeling of DEVS systems using the GUI library and the drag-and-drop approach.


# Requirements
The use of DEVSimPy requires:

- Python version 2.4+
- wxPython version 2.6+ ansi/unicode (unicode recommended)
- Scipy and Numpy (optional, for spectrum analysis)
- DEVSimPy should be used like a normal Python file, i.e., double-clicking on the devsimpy.py file which is located in the root directory or writing python devismpy.py into a python console.

Users which don't want to install python with all dependency can use Portable Python (version 2.x). Then, just extract DEVSimPy archive and edit the devsimpy.py file with PyScripter to execute it.

# Features
With DEVSimPy we can:

- Model a DEVS system and save or export it into a library
- Edit the code of DEVS model to modify behavior's also during the simulation
- Import existing library of models (python code or DEVSimPy specific models) which allows the specific domain modeling (Power system, continuous, etc)
- Automatically simulate the system and perform its analysis during the simulation (with the suspend option)
